                In four-years time, 2007, High School was permitted to operate headed by Pastor Roldolfo Evangelista,
                Principal, but it was moved to the Main Building (now) and the original building, where it all started,
                was
                made annex. The following year, 2008, Mr. Moises M. Pilande, Jr. took over the principal's chair. There
                were only twelve fourth year students who had graduated during its first year and then there were 36.
                Today, there are already three (3) sections every graduation year. There was also a separate elementary
                offering when Mrs. Julieta Arana headed it.
                <br>
                <br>
                Mrs. Milagros A. Guevarra succeeded in 2010 until the present. But in 2014, elementary classes were
                altogether transferred to annex so as to distinctly distinguish the grades-school from the high school.
                Significantly, in this same year, the school was approved and certified by the Department of Education
                through the Fund for Assistance to Private Education to first year students until they finish Senior
                High.

                College started operating in 2009 with only TESDA Courses offered. It was a concerted effort from the
                administrators who had helped established what it is today. Dr. Santos T. Castillo, Jr. actively
                sustained
                the operation since late 2013 as Vice President for Academic Affairs. (Past Deans and Heads---Mr.
                Leandro Cabantog (2009) Dr. Teresita G. Pivalcerin- (2010) Lito Fabregar (2011) Dr. Violita Sarmiento
                (2011-2015) Dr. Nerus Malinis (2015-Present). The following year, Education (Secondary-English and
                Math Major, & Elementaky) and Business Administration were added to the roster of choices to the
                college students. To date, there are more additional TESDA courses offered and scholarships are also up
                for grabs.
                <br>
                <br>
                2016 marks two additional tasks to the progressing academic growth of the technical and education
                thrust of the institution. We now implement Senior High School curriculum with emphasis on
                technology and vocational tracks and TERNATE TESDA Branch has been opened with the same courses
                offered as in the main, in answer to the necessity and accessibility to the area where the haven of Sir
                Bong is situated.
                Aimed at creating literate populace, this Christian institution promises to be your real school to shape
                you a better future! pjdc
